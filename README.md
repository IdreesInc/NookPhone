## What is it?
This is a simple remake of the NookPhone home screen UI written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. It is just a design mockup and **does not** function like the NookPhone in any fashion, as in the app icons are just there for show and clicking them will not enter any new context.

## What is the JavaScript for?
There is a small amount of JavaScript used for setting the clock and changing the app name when different apps are hovered over. The animations and design are otherwise completely HTML/CSS based.

## Assets
The app icons are from [this](https://imgur.com/t/animalcrossingnewhorizons/jeZHQZL) imgur album which seem to be based directly on the NookPhone icons in the Animal Crossing New Horizons game. The status bar icons are also modeled after the in-game icons.
